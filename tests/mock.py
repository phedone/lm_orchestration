mock_transcript = """Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling XYZ Internet Services. How can I help you today?
Client: Good morning. I'm having serious issues with my internet connection, and it's been ongoing for a while now. I'd like to file a complaint.
Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues. Could I start by getting your account number, please?
Client: I have two account NUMBER. One is 1234567890 and the other one, which I don't have with me right now, belongs to my wife.
Agent: Thank you. And may I have your name?
Client: My name is Jean Dupont. My wife, Marie Dupont, is also on the account.
Agent: Thank you, Mr. Dupont. Can you provide your phone number in case we need to contact you for further details?
Client: Certainly, my number is 0612345678. Unfortunately, I don't have my wife's phone number right now.
Agent: That's alright. Could you describe the problem you're facing with your internet connection?
Client: The internet speed has been very slow, and we experience frequent disconnections, especially during the evenings. This problem has been persisting for about two weeks now. We also noticed that the Wi-Fi signal is weak in some parts of the house.
Agent: I understand how frustrating that must be. Did you previously file any complaints or tickets regarding this issue?
Client: Yes, I did. I have two tracking NUMBER. One is 9876543210 from last week, and another one from two days ago, but I don't have it with me right now.
Agent: Thank you. Do you remember the identifier of your internet box contract?
Client: I don't have that information with me at the moment.
Agent: No problem. Could you tell me the best time for a technician to visit? It can be a specific date or time like 'this evening,' 'tomorrow,' or a particular hour.
Client: We're generally available in the afternoons. Tomorrow at 3 PM would work, or the day after at the same time. However, if possible, we'd prefer a visit during the weekend.
Agent: Got it. Just to summarize, you have a complaint about slow and intermittent internet connection. Your account NUMBER are 1234567890, and another account under your wife's name which you don't have on hand. Your name is Jean Dupont, and your phone number is 0612345678. You previously filed complaints with tracking NUMBER 9876543210 and another one which you can't recall right now. We'll arrange for a technician to visit you either tomorrow at 3 PM or the day after at the same time, with a preference for the weekend if possible. Is that correct?
Client: Yes, that's correct. Also, can the technician check our television service? Some channels don't load properly, and we often see an error message.
Agent: Certainly. Can you give me more details about the issue with your TV service?
Client: Sure, some channels just show a blank screen or an error message. It happens sporadically, but it's quite annoying. We also subscribed to a premium channel package that we can't seem to access.
Agent: Thank you for letting us know. I'll add that to your complaint, and we'll make sure to check it during the technician's visit. Do you remember the premium package details?
Client: Yes, it's the Sports Extra package, but none of the channels are accessible.
Agent: Got it. So, in addition to the internet issue, we'll have the technician check your television service, including the Sports Extra package. Anything else?
Client: Actually, yes. We've also been having trouble with our phone line. Sometimes, calls drop unexpectedly, and there's a lot of static noise.
Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you give me more details about the phone line issue?
Client: Sure, the static noise happens mostly during evenings. And calls drop frequently, even when the weather is clear.
Agent: Thank you for providing that information. I'll add the phone line issue to your complaint as well. Just to confirm, we are addressing issues with your internet connection, television service including the Sports Extra package, and your phone line. We'll have a technician visit you either tomorrow at 3 PM, the day after at the same time, or preferably during the weekend. Is that correct?
Client: Yes, that's correct. Thank you for your help.
Agent: You're welcome, Mr. Dupont. We'll do our best to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. Have a great day!
Client: Thank you. You too!
Agent: Just to make sure, do you have any other concerns or issues that you'd like to address today?
Client: No, that covers it for now.
Agent: Alright, Mr. Dupont. So, we have noted the issues with your internet, television, and phone services. A technician will visit you as discussed. If you need to reschedule, please don't hesitate to call us back. Have a great day!
Client: Thanks again. Goodbye.
Agent: Goodbye, Mr. Dupont."""
